    <h1>Processor</h1>
    <h3>General information</h3>
    <p>The processor, also known as the central processing unit (CPU), is an essential component of any computer. It serves as the brain of the system, responsible for performing computations and controlling other components.
        Its main tasks include data processing, executing program instructions, and managing system resources. It is responsible for the operation of the operating system, programs, and applications.
        It's important to note that the processor works in conjunction with other computer components such as RAM, graphics card, and hard drive. Optimal compatibility between these components can further enhance system performance and efficiency.
        </p>
        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p>Processors are composed of billions of transistors that enable logical operations on data. The number of transistors directly affects the performance of the processor â€“ the more transistors, the greater the computational capabilities.
            The architecture of a processor includes several components, such as the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), control unit (CU), cache memory, and data and address buses. The collaboration of these elements enables the processor to operate efficiently and effectively.        </p>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>The speed of a processor is measured in hertz (Hz) or its multiples, such as megahertz (MHz) or gigahertz (GHz). A higher clock frequency indicates faster instruction execution, which translates to better performance.
            Multicore technology is an important feature of modern processors. It means that the processor contains multiple cores that can work independently. Multicore architecture allows for parallel execution of multiple tasks, improving overall system performance.
            Other factors affecting processor performance include cache size, manufacturing technology (e.g., 14 nm, 7 nm), and optimized instructions (e.g., SIMD) that enable acceleration of certain operations.</p>

        Manufacturers of processors, such as Intel, AMD, and ARM, continually introduce innovations to enhance the performance and functionality of their products. Modern processors support advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and high-performance computing.
        The choice of the right processor depends on the individual needs of the user. Requirements vary depending on the application, for example, gamers and graphic designers prefer processors with high computational power, while home users may be satisfied with a processor of moderate performance.    </div>
